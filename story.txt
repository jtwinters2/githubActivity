In the great green room, there was a telephone, and a red balloon, and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon. And there were three little bears sitting on chairs, and two little kittens, and a pair of mittens, and a little toy house, and a young mouse, and a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush and a quiet old lady who was whispering “hush”. Goodnight room, goodnight moon, goodnight cow jumping over the moon, goodnight light and the red balloon. Goodnight bears, goodnight chairs, goodnight kittens and goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks and goodnight socks, goodnight little house and goodnight mouse. Goodnight comb, and goodnight brush, goodnight nobody, goodnight mush, and goodnight to the old lady whispering “hush”. Goodnight stars, goodnight air, goodnight noises everywhere.

Then everyone slept.  The black of night crept over the land envolping everyone and everything.  The only sounds were of the disnant snoring of the sleeping inhabitents.  All of a sudden there was a loud bang in the middle of the great green room.  Every little creature was startled awake.  "What was that?" someone called out in a shakey voice.  "I don't know," another responded, "but lets go find out." (Mike Spreitzer)

A group of people got up to go see where that noise came from. Curiosity filled the room as people began to desperately search for the source of the bang. "Could it have been a bear", the old grandma yelled out in her feeble voice. The grandmother's son was getting frustrated with his grandmother's comments. Lanterns, flashlights, and candles illuminated the city as people began wondering about. Finally a little child says "I found a giant rock". Everybody comes running over to where the child was located. This was no ordinary boulder. It seemed like a meteor that had struck the city. Tonight marked the night of a new beginning in the great green room.
